<h1 align="center">Hello üòä, I'm Keren Shay!</h1>

# üí´ About Me:
  üåê I am a dedicated and ambitious student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at the Open University of Israel. My academic journey is fueled by a deep passion for technology and a relentless curiosity to explore how it can be harnessed to solve complex, real-world problems. I am particularly interested in the intersection of software development, data science, and emerging technologies, and I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.

üíª My technical skills encompass a broad spectrum of programming languages and development frameworks, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end web development, as well as React JS for creating dynamic, user-centric interfaces. On the back end, I have experience with Node.js and SQL, which have allowed me to build and manage robust, scalable server-side applications. My proficiency in Python and Java further complements my ability to tackle a variety of software engineering challenges, while my knowledge of C# adds an additional layer of versatility to my skill set.

üìö Beyond the classroom, I am an active learner who is always on the lookout for new challenges and learning opportunities. I regularly engage with online courses, tutorials, and developer communities to stay updated on the latest trends and best practices in software development. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing, and I am eager to delve deeper into these areas as I progress in my studies and career.

üîó I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, fellow students, and industry experts. If you share my passion for technology and innovation, or if you're interested in collaborating on exciting projects, I would love to hear from you!
